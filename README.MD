### Overview

This project aims to create a small TypeScript application that randomizes the colors of clothes, specifically pants, shirts, and shoes. The application generates random colors for each clothing item and displays them on the screen. It allows users to click a button to randomize the colors and see different combinations of clothing colors.

## Description
The software is built using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It consists of a simple user interface that displays three clothing items: pants, shirts, and shoes. Each clothing item is represented by a rectangular shape, and the colors of these items are randomized upon user interaction.

The application utilizes event handling in TypeScript to detect button clicks and trigger the color randomization process. Upon clicking the "Randomize" button, the application generates random RGB values for each clothing item, creating unique color combinations.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this software is to enhance learning and practice software engineering skills. By developing this small project, software engineers can gain hands-on experience with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. They can strengthen their understanding of event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic user interface design.

# Development Environment

* `TypeScript`: TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations and additional features to the JavaScript language. It provides better tooling, improved code maintainability, and increased developer productivity. The project utilized TypeScript for writing the application logic and handling the randomization of clothing colors.

* `HTML`: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages. It was used to define the structure and layout of the user interface elements in the application.

* `CSS`: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It was used to style the clothing items, buttons, and overall appearance of the application.

## Programming Language:
The primary programming language used in this project is `TypeScript`. `TypeScript` is a powerful language that allows developers to write scalable and maintainable `JavaScript` code. It provides features such as static typing, classes, interfaces, and modules, which enable better code organization and improve the overall development experience.
